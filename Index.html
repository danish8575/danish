    <h1>The importance of clean water </h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Clean water is a basic need for every human being.
        We use water every day for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and farming. Without clean water, life becomes very difficult.
        Sadly, many people in the world still do not have access to clean and safe water
    </p>
    <h2>Why clean water is important</h2>
    <p>
        Clean water keeps us healthy.
        If we drink dirty water, it can cause diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea.
        These diseases can be very dangerous, especially for children. Clean water also helps us to keep our surroundings clean.
        It is also important for growing crops and raising animals.

    <h2>Problem of Dirty water</h2>
    <p>
         many areas, people use water from rivers, lakes, or ponds which are dirty.
         This water may have germs, waste, or harmful chemicals. Sometimes, factories throw their waste into rivers.
         This pollutes the water and makes it unsafe. Climate change and lack of rain also reduce the availability of clean water.
    </p>
    <h2>How to solve this problem</h2>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we must protect our water sources.
         We should not throw garbage in rivers or ponds. 
         Factories must treat their waste before releasing it. 
         Governments should build water cleaning plants. 
         People should also learn to save water and use it wisely. 
         Installing water filters at home is also helpful.
